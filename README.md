# Event Monkey

## WaW (What and Why)

I am making a big project. So big that my puny brain can't handle it all in once. So I am making it in separate modules. I call it Blog Monkey. It'll be awesome.  
Event Monkey is a small test of concept module of Blog Monkey. Blog Monkey as the name say is about blogging. So I am working with a group of people which do blogging full time, as a profession. So one thing they do is create small-life websites for events/festivals etc.  
These websites contain little predictable content and lot of keyword stuffing. Why do they do it? To make money of course. These sites rank high when they are initially indexed by Google (or so they say), and are brought down after the even has passed to prevent any penalty from Google. According to them, these receive lot of traffic for small time and make good money.  
So I automated the content generation of such sites, and I call it Event Monkey: Domain Specific Automatic Content generation module for Blog Monkey.
This system has more potential and has lot of rough edges, but I wanted to test it in real field before putting any more work into it. Valentine's day of 2014 will be that test.  
Those guys have made some websites for valentines day, and I have made some with this system. If this system doesn't work, or this trick of making money with short-life websites fail, I'll probably not update this repository. Yes, I am that lazy.  

## Quick Documentation

I would have written the documentation but I don't think anybody else gonna use this system. I am putting it here because this inactive Github account is haunting me in dreams.
